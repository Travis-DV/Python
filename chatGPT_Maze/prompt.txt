can you make a class named "wall_peace" in python with a variable named "turtle" with a default value of turtle.Turtle(). A verable named "type" with a default value of "null". A verable named "open_side" property with a default value of 0. Then can you make a 10 by 10 list of new instances of "wall_peace" with the middle 2 by 2 having a type of "ending"can you make a class named "wall_peace" in python with a variable named "turtle" with a default value of turtle.Turtle().

Have a random path generation code where it can not go past 10 or less that 0 it starts somewhere around a 10 by 10 and ends in a 2 by 2 in the center it randomly decides to go up down left or right
